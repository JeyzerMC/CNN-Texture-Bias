\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
The history of computer vision led us to believe that like us, CNNs recognize 
objects mainly by their shapes. The paper we reproduce introduces a new hypothesis: modern
CNNs are more texture biased than shape biased. The autors verified this hypothesis, and were
able to train CNNs to better recognize shapes, and surpass the State of the Art on Imagenet classification.

\section{Introduction}

% https://hackernoon.com/a-brief-history-of-computer-vision-and-convolutional-neural-networks-8fe8aacc79f3

Modern Convolutional Neural Networks reach very high performances on complex computer vision tasks like
Image classification and Image Segmentation
These performances are comparable with human perception and they come from a long history of studies.
It is important to understand those studies t


The first proof that edges are fundamental for vision came from a very influencal study of cognition:
  “Receptive fields of single neurons in the cat’s striate cortex”
described how biological neurons extracted features from images. It showed that certain types of
neurons were activated by edges.

The convolution of an image with a sobel filter is known to extract edges.
Other filters can extract other image features. However, the filters had to be handcrafted, and
the most significant features of an image had to be determined by a human.

Another paper showed that vision was hierachical. Low-level features (simple shapes like lines)
were combined to recognize high level features (like wheels, windows ...).

The famous Neocognition paper was the implementation of the idea of hierachical vision.
This multilayered neural network included convolutional layers with wheighted receptive fields (filters).
It was the first deep neural network.

The first modern convnet was LeNet \cite{Lecun98gradient-basedlearning}
It used backpropgation to automatically learn the filter values to extract meaningful features in images hierachically.
All the modern ConvNets are inspired from this network.

ConvNet were considered like a black box for a long time.
This is why efforts were made to analyze the internals of these networks.

The shape hypothesis is that "High-level units appear to learn
representations of shapes occurring in natural images” \cite{Kriegeskorte029876}
This hypothesis is widespread in the comunity, and
it is understandable given the history of computer vision.
There are a lot of experiments comparing human vision with computer vision.
X states that "implicitly learn representations of shape
 that reflect human shape perception".
Y said that "that  state-of-the-artone  shot  learning  models  trained  on  ImageNetexhibit  a  similar  bias  to  that  observed  in  hu-mans:  
they prefer to categorize objects according  to  shape  rather  than  color" \cite{ritter2017cognitive}

However, several studies raise doubts about this hypothesis.
According to X, CNNs are able to classify texturised images even if their shape structure is destraoyed.
Moreover, Y showed that CNNs with constrained receptive field sizes can reach competitive accuracies on ImageNet.
It is worth noticing that small receptive fields cannot capture the overal shape of an image.
These results have led the authors of the paper we reproduce \cite{geirhos2018imagenettrained} 
to emit a new hypothesis: the texture hypothesis where "in contrast to the
common assumption, object textures are more important than global object shapes for CNN object
recognition".

Our objective is to test these hypothesis with diverse experiments.

\section{Methodology}

To begin with, we reproduced the first experiment of the paper. This experiment
is represents the misconception we have about how CNNs learn.


We can see that the pretrained CNN recognized the elephant with just its texture.
More interestingly, it recognized it classified the cat shape with elephant texture as an elephant.
The texture hypothesis is more likely to be true.
Let's define more robust experiments to verify that.

\subsubsection{References}

The references section is headed ``References'', printed in the same
style as a section heading but without a number. A sample list of
references is given at the end of these instructions. Use a consistent
format for references. The reference list should not include unpublished
work.


\section{Tables}

Tables are considered illustrations containing data. Therefore, they should also appear floated to the top (preferably) or bottom of the page, and with the captions below them.
