# Datasets used for the experiments.

### Please note that these datasets are not ours.

## Textures 

The textures are hand-picked textures that gave us the best results in our tests, 
from the Describable Textures Dataset (DTD). 

Please refer to their website for the full dataset: https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/dtd/.

## Imagenette2-160

This dataset comes from https://github.com/fastai/imagenette. 

We've renamed the folders and uploaded it to facilitate reproduction of our experiment by the correctors.

As always, please refer to the original dataset (fastai's website) if you wish to use it for your own experiments.

## Stylized-imagenette2-160

This dataset was stylized from the imagenette-160 using the chosen pictures. 
The script used to stylized the images is available in notebooks/stylize-dataset.ipynb and is issued from:
